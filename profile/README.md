## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Ever jump straight into building an idea without overthinking it? That feeling is what weâ€™re after.**

Too many great ideas die in the overthinking phase. 
We realized we could build most of what we dreamed up, and that realization was powerful. 
It freed us to start making things immediately, or keep brainstorming without holding back.
Thatâ€™s why we started whynotmake.it a collective building tools to help you feel that same empowerment. 

We want more people to stop hesitating and just build their ideas.
