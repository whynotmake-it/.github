## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ever had an idea that you liked, and without thinking about it too much, you just jumped into making it a reality straight away? 
We think that so many good ideas get lost in a phase of overthinking. 
And we love the feeling of empowerment we got from realising that we can actually build most of the ideas we had. 
It allows you to start building right away, or keep brainstorming and come up with even better stuff, without inhibiting yourself. 
We decided to start **why not make it?**, as a collective to stand for this sentiment. And to empower more people to have this thought more often.

### What we build
We maintain a couple of open source projects to make your life better. Check out all of them [here](https://github.com/orgs/whynotmake-it/repositories)!
Some of our highlights:

- [figmage](https://github.com/whynotmake-it/figmage) â€“ A magical CLI tool for generating Figma styles for Flutter themeing
- [Dart Coverage Assistant](https://github.com/whynotmake-it/dart-coverage-assistant) â€“ A plug-and-play GitHub Action to handle all your code coverage needs (reports, badges, etc.)

### What we write
We also run a blog at [whynotmake.it](https://whynotmake.it), where we give you empowering, no-boilerplate articles about UX-Engineering and the world of Flutter.
